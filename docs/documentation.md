## Users

### <a name="user-root">`/user`</a>

#### Description

Endpoint representing the `user` resource. See `Operations and Schemas` for more information of each operation.

#### Operations and Schemas

---

This route is _protected_. A valid token retrieved either from `/login` or `/registration` is needed. Please check this [Stack Overflow Answer](https://stackoverflow.com/a/42879201) on information on how to pass this token along with the request with Axios.

---

<a name="user-get">**GET**</a>

Returns information about the current logged in user. There is no need to specify `userId`: the user ID is read from the token passed in the Authorization header with the request.

_Output Schema_:

- 200 OK

```js
{
    user: {
        "id": number,
        "username": string,
        "email": string,**6702803862**
        "providerId"?: number, // ? means it may or may not be there.
        "createdAt": DateString, // string with a formatted date
        "patients": array
    }
}
```

There is no `providerId` if the user account is not associated with a provider.

[Back to top](#toc)

<a name="user-put">**PUT**</a>

_Input Schema_:

```js
{
    "username"?: string, // ? means property is optional (doesn't have to be there).
    "password"?: string,
    "email"?: string
}
```

At least one property must exist in JSON body. Otherwise, the route will respond with `400 Bad Request`.

_Output Schema_:

- 200 OK

```js
{
    success: {
        // Will contain details of the updated user sans password
        "id": number,
        "username": string,
        "email": string,
        "createdAt": DateString, // string with a formatted date
        "patients": array
    }
}
```

[Back to top](#toc)

<a name="user-delete">**DELETE**</a>

_Output Schema_:

- 200 OK

```js
{
    "usersDeleted": number,
}
```

Returns the number of users deleted. This number should always be `1`. If it's more than `1`, contact the backend people.

If less than `1`, you should get a `404: Not Found` instead, signifying that the user cannot be found. Since the user to be deleted is identified by the token, a `404` may mean that the token is old and can be discarded. /_ Potentially inaccurate, will review - ER _/

## Patients

### <a name="patient-root">`/patients`</a>

#### Description

Endpoint dealing with the `patient` resource. There are two operations, GET and POST. The GET operation will return an array of patients associated with the user. If the user is a provider, it will return an array of all patients that have given the provider consent. The POST operation will allow a user to add a new patient associated with its account, and will not function for a provider account.

```js
{
    "success": {
        // Returns the created patient
        "id": number,
